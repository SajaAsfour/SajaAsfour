## 📂 Highlighted Projects

I have worked on a variety of academic and personal projects across several domains. In embedded and digital systems, I designed a **multi-cycle MIPS processor using Verilog** and developed a **medical test management system in MIPS Assembly**, demonstrating my low-level programming and digital logic skills.

In web and network applications, I built a full **Pharmacy Management System** using Flask and MySQL and created multiple **network simulations** using Packet Tracer, focusing on advanced configurations like **OSPF routing, VLAN setups**, and **DNS/mail servers**. I also developed **Python-based client-server applications** utilizing both TCP and UDP communication protocols.

On the mobile development side, I built several **Flutter applications** including **doctor profile management**, **user registration/login systems**, **BMI calculators**, and **to-do/task apps**, some of which integrate Firebase and advanced UI features. These projects reflect my ability to create intuitive and functional mobile experiences.

In the field of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, I explored **Arabic handwritten text recognition** using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning, worked on **job-shop scheduling optimization** via Genetic Algorithms, and performed **ECG signal noise reduction** using adaptive filtering techniques—showcasing my grasp of AI and signal processing principles.
